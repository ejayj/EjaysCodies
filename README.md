# EjayCodiesv2
This is my version of codies.xyz just for friends!
This site is hosted live on: https://ejayscodies-wnlf.onrender.com
note: this game does not host rooms since its just for myself and some friends!

Built With:
CSS, Javascript, HTML
Node, Express, Socket.io (for online gameplay with friends)

How To Play:

Get into equal teams, Red or Blue. Each team chooses 1 spymaster.
Spymasters hit the 'Spymaster' button to see their colors.
On your turn, your spymaster can only give a one-word hint.
Players will then choose which word is their answer.
First team who's score to reaches zero wins!
RULES:

If you choose the other team's word, your team's turn ends.
If you accidentally choose the 'bomb' word, your team loses!
Only the spymaster gets to see the colors of the board
A team may pass their turn up by hitting the end turn button.
Other Options:
Timer: Activates a time limit of your choosing
Bomb: This hides or show's the bomb for spymasters.


Tutorial:
To use this on your own, fork the repository and use 'npm install' if you don't have node already.
Then, simply type 'yarn' to build all the packages and dependencies used for this project (there wasn't much).
Lastly, define the port (its 8080 by default), and use 'node index.js' to run the application. 

If you're doing local host, the game will still work. If you wish to do online play, I reccomend using onrender or some other web service. 

If you were like me and just wanted a quick and easy way to play and you wish to simply play local with friends on one computer, you'd have to have the spymasters memorize where a few of the words are before the rest of the players look at your screen.
